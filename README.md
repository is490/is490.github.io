# Will You Be My Valentine?

Welcome to the "Will You Be My Valentine?" project, a playful and interactive way to ask that special someone the big question this Valentine's Day. Hosted as a GitHub Page, this project offers a unique blend of creativity and technology to make your Valentine's Day proposal unforgettable.
This project was created by  Quang Thanh (byquangthanh). I used the same code and made some minor changes (color palette, food/dessert/activities options etc) to ask out my boyfriend for Valentine's day. The full credit of the project goes to [byquangthanh](https://github.com/byquangthanh) and if you would like to remake a similar project for yourself, please start by forking the Quang's [project repository](https://github.com/byquangthanh/valentine.github.io) on GitHub. I have added a "How to Contribute" section below (copied from Quang's readme) to help you make contributions to the original project.
More details regarding the project can also be found on Quang's github page: [byquangthanh](https://github.com/byquangthanh).
